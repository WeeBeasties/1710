<h2>Summary statistics</h2>
<p>A total of 748 student performances on Ferris Learning Outcome 3 were collected over 21 different math courses. Student scores were converted to rubric scores as described above. The overall average rubric score for all students and semesters was 2.69. The mode and median scores were 4 and 3, respectively. The average was not statistically different from the threshold score for competence (2.6) as evaluated with a one-value, two-tailed t-test (t=1.75, df=747, p=0.081). The effect size for the difference between the average and the threshold was tiny (d=0.06). We can infer from this that the overall average rubric score is not practically different than the threshold score. A total of 31 courses were initially registered to submit data for the semester, so we achieved a 67.7% completion rate. According to Banner records, 1,997 students were enrolled in Quantitative Literacy courses in the fall semester. We captured 37.5% of this population with our census.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>
Do you think that this level of performance on the outcome is sufficient? Or, do you think that there is a need to increase this level?

Figure 1: A histogram of the distribution of individual rubric score frequencies over all thirteen semesters.
</p>
</div>
<p>The distribution of all rubric scores is shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:histogram">1</a>. This distribution exhibited a moderate negative skew (skew = -0.86). This result may simply indicate that the teaching, materials, and student learning are all functioning well when the scores are viewed in aggregate. A total of 502 students (67.1%) met or exceeded the competence threshold over the semesters investigated.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>
Do you think that this distribution of rubric scores seems right? Are there too many ones and fours, or is this distribution expected in these courses?
</p>
</div>
<p>The distribution of rubric scores by course is shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:barplot">2</a>. There are rather obvious differences in both the distribution of rubric scores and class sizes between semesters.</p>

<p>
What do you think accounts for the variability in scoring from course to course. Is this a problem in measurement, or does the variation reflect real differences in the course populations?

<div id="meta-analysis" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Meta-analysis of the student performance was performed using R <span class="citation">(Del Re <a href="references.html#ref-TQMP11-1-37">2015</a>)</span>. This analysis resulted in a weighted average of rubric scores. This value was calculated using formula <a href="results.html#eq:weightX">(1)</a>. The value <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span> average rubric scores for the semesters, while <span class="math inline">\(P_{i}\)</span> is the weighting factor (student enrollment).</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:weightX">\[\begin{equation}
\bar{X}_w = \frac{\sum X_i P_i}{\sum P_i}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>The confidence interval for the weighted mean was calculated using the weighted variance. However, the weighted variance is actually not simple to calculate. Several different methods have been compared to bootstrapping <span class="citation">(Gatz and Smith <a href="references.html#ref-Gatz1995a">1995</a>)</span>. The most accurate method was initially described by Cochran <span class="citation">(Cochran <a href="references.html#ref-Cochran1977">1977</a>)</span> and that one was used in this study. The calculation to obtain the weighted variance is shown in formula <a href="results.html#eq:weightV">(2)</a>.</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:weightV">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(SEM_w)^2 = \frac{n}{(n-1)(\sum P_i)^2}\big[ \sum(P_i X_i - \bar{P}\bar{X}_w)^2 \\
- 2\bar{X}_w \sum(P_i - \bar{P})(P_i X_ i - \bar{P} \bar{X}_w) + \bar{X}_w^2 \sum(P_i - \bar{P})^2 \big]
\end{split}
\tag{2}
\end{equation}\]</span>

</p>
</div>
<p>A forest plot of the meta-analysis is shown in Figure <a href="results.html#fig:forest">3</a>. In this representation, each semester is illustrated as a separate line. The mean and 95% confidence intervals for each semester are plotted in the right panel and their associated meta-data are given in the table to the left. The weighted average of all the data is plotted at the bottom of the figure. The width of the diamond indicates the 95% confidence interval.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>
Do you think that this reflects the actual status of student performance in these courses?
</p>
</div>
<p>The rubric scale can be conceptually divided into five areas as shown in Table <a href="results.html#tab:regions">2</a>. Of the 21 semesters, 10 fell in the proficient range, 9 fell in the developing range, and 2 fell in the beginning range. The weighted mean score was not significantly different from the threshold of competence as judged by a weighted, one-factor, two-tailed t-test (t=0.63, df=20, p=0.53). We can conclude that the weighted average score is practically equivalent to the competency threshold score.</p>
