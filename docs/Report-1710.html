<h1>Abstract</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“Assessment is not a spreadsheet; it’s a conversation.” — Irmeli Halinen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This report is the first quantitative literacy analysis for the new General Education assessment strategy at Ferris State University. A total of 748 student performances on Ferris Learning Outcome 3 were collected over 21 different math courses. Student scores were converted to rubric scores as described above. The overall average rubric score for all students and semesters was 2.69. The mode and median scores were 4 and 3, respectively. The average was not statistically different from the threshold score for competence (2.6) as evaluated with a one-value, two-tailed t-test (t=1.75, df=747, p=0.081). The effect size for the difference between the average and the threshold was tiny (d=0.06). We can infer from this that the overall average rubric score is not practically different than the threshold score. A total of 31 courses were initially registered to submit data for the semester, so we achieved a 67.7% completion rate. According to Banner records, 1,997 students were enrolled in Quantitative Literacy courses in the fall semester. We captured 37.5% of this population with our census.</p>

<div id="intro" class="section level1 unnumbered">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Assessment is perhaps best viewed as a scholarly activity that is focused upon programmatic improvement. Such scholarly work should be built upon, and contribute to, the relevant professional literature <span class="citation">(Weimer <a href="#ref-Weimer2015">2015</a>)</span>. To emphasize that reality, this report is formatted in the form of a journal article. This report, and ones like it, will be authored, published, and cited in future work to support the development and improvement of the General Education program at Ferris. In addition, reports like this will be the focus of presentations to faculty to suppport continuous improvement of student learning. This report is an analysis of course-level assessment data from 100- and 200-level Math courses in the Fall of 2017. Twenty-one different embedded course assignments were used to evaluate our students’ abilities with regard to quantitative literacy outcome QNT3: Apply approaches – Students apply quantitative approaches within contexts to solve problems and draw plausible conclusions.</p>

<h2>Collection of assessment data</h2>
<p>Student performances on embedded assignments in 100- and 200-level mathematics courses were analyzed. The content assessed probably varied considerabley. However, all assignments presumably aligned with the QNT3 learning outcome. Individual student scores were collected using the new General Education Natural Sciences “scores” data workbook . Student scores were automatically converted to a rubric score by the workbook using the equivalencies shown in Table <a href="#tab:convert">1</a>.</p>

<h2>De-identification of student data</h2>
<p>Copies of the 21 data files were downloaded from TracDat. An R aggregator script was used to read the data from these data sheets and concatenate it into one data set in a destructive process – the downloaded copies were deleted in the process. Student names and identification numbers were redacted and each student’s entry was given a unique eight-digit identifier - the Record.Key. These keys may be used for longitudinal studies in the future. The algorithm used is kept in an encrypted site and shared with <em>no one</em>. The de-identified data set contains 748 student entries and is formatted as a comma-delimited text file (reportData.csv).</p>

<h2>Summary statistics</h2>
<p>A total of 748 student performances on Ferris Learning Outcome 3 were collected over 21 different math courses. Student scores were converted to rubric scores as described above. The overall average rubric score for all students and semesters was 2.69. The mode and median scores were 4 and 3, respectively. The average was not statistically different from the threshold score for competence (2.6) as evaluated with a one-value, two-tailed t-test (t=1.75, df=747, p=0.081). The effect size for the difference between the average and the threshold was tiny (d=0.06). We can infer from this that the overall average rubric score is not practically different than the threshold score. A total of 31 courses were initially registered to submit data for the semester, so we achieved a 67.7% completion rate.

<p>The distribution of all rubric scores is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:histogram">1</a>. This distribution exhibited a moderate negative skew (skew = -0.86). This result may simply indicate that the teaching, materials, and student learning are all functioning well when the scores are viewed in aggregate. A total of 502 students (67.1%) met or exceeded the competence threshold over the semesters investigated.</p>

<h2>Meta-analysis</h2>
<p>Meta-analysis of the student performance was performed using R <span class="citation">(Del Re <a href="#ref-TQMP11-1-37">2015</a>)</span>. This analysis resulted in a weighted average of rubric scores. This value was calculated using formula <a href="#eq:weightX">(1)</a>. The value <span class="math inline">\(X_{i}\)</span> average rubric scores for the semesters, while <span class="math inline">\(P_{i}\)</span> is the weighting factor (student enrollment).</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:weightX">\[\begin{equation}
\bar{X}_w = \frac{\sum X_i P_i}{\sum P_i}
\tag{1}
\end{equation}\]</span>
<p>The confidence interval for the weighted mean was calculated using the weighted variance. However, the weighted variance is actually not simple to calculate. Several different methods have been compared to bootstrapping <span class="citation">(Gatz and Smith <a href="#ref-Gatz1995a">1995</a>)</span>. The most accurate method was initially described by Cochran <span class="citation">(Cochran <a href="#ref-Cochran1977">1977</a>)</span> and that one was used in this study. The calculation to obtain the weighted variance is shown in formula <a href="#eq:weightV">(2)</a>.</p>
<span class="math display" id="eq:weightV">\[\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(SEM_w)^2 = \frac{n}{(n-1)(\sum P_i)^2}\big[ \sum(P_i X_i - \bar{P}\bar{X}_w)^2 \\
- 2\bar{X}_w \sum(P_i - \bar{P})(P_i X_ i - \bar{P} \bar{X}_w) + \bar{X}_w^2 \sum(P_i - \bar{P})^2 \big]
\end{split}
\tag{2}

Figure 3: A forest plot of the average scores for each course with a weighted mean estimate for the entire period investigated. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals.
</p>
</div>
<p>A forest plot of the meta-analysis is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:forest">3</a>. In this representation, each semester is illustrated as a separate line. The mean and 95% confidence intervals for each semester are plotted in the right panel and their associated meta-data are given in the table to the left. The weighted average of all the data is plotted at the bottom of the figure. The width of the diamond indicates the 95% confidence interval.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>
Do you think that this reflects the actual status of student performance in these courses?
</p>
</div>
<p>The rubric scale can be conceptually divided into five areas as shown in Table <a href="#tab:regions">2</a>. Of the 21 semesters, 10 fell in the proficient range, 9 fell in the developing range, and 2 fell in the beginning range. The weighted mean score was not significantly different from the threshold of competence as judged by a weighted, one-factor, two-tailed t-test (t=0.63, df=20, p=0.53). We can conclude that the weighted average score is practically equivalent to the competency threshold score.</p>

<p>The average rubric scores for 100-level and 200-level courses was 2.73 and 2.53, respectively . Both of these averages are near the threshold value of 2.6. The difference between these scores was not statistically different as evaluated with a two-tailed t-test (t=1.49, df=205.41, p=0.14). The effect size for the difference between was tiny (d=0.1). We can infer from this that there was no evidence of a measurable difference in student performance by course level.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>
The performance in 200-level students is no better than that of 100-level students. Is this a concern, or are these results expected for these courses? Why or why not?

<h1>Discussion</h1>
<p>A novel approach for the collection, aggregation, analysis, and reporting of General Education assessment data has been developed. Computationally reproducible reports can easily be generated and distributed to improve the program over time. A meta-analysis of data collected for the first time from a selection of Mathematics courses. Over a total of 21 courses, 47.6% had mean scores considered to be proficient. Of all students in all semesters, 67.1% met or exceeded the competence threshold. From these data it is inferred that the students are about at the threshold of competence. Disaggregation of scores by standard measure employed, course level, student race, student gender, and Pell eligibility all failed to find any significant differences in student performance.</p>
<div id="faculty-feedback" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Faculty feedback</h2>
<p>This report has been distributed to members of the General Education Committee, Academic Senate, and the Department of Mathematics at Ferris State Univerity. These individuals were asked to provide their comments, suggestions, and concerns about this report and the processes involved in its creation. Their reflections are captured in the Disqus comments within this report. Summary of their ideas and action steps will eventually be included in an Addendum section to this report.</p>
</div>
<div id="plan-of-action" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Plan of action</h2>
<p>After analyzing the data and considering the comments provided in the faculty feedback, the relevant General Education sub-committee members will make one or more recommendations for future work. Some of the possible actions could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No modifications – continue to gather data</li>
<li>Convene a training session to get better inter-course reliability</li>
<li>Suggest modifications to the types of assignments that are used</li>
<li>Suggest modifications to which data workbooks are used</li>
<li>Suggest that instructors consider modifying the scope or sequence of instruction</li>
<li>Modify the learning outcomes themselves</li>
<li>Modify the competency as a whole</li>
